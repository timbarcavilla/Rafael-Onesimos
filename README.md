### How our game works
Our game is a pokemon adventure game similar to the real ones. In the game the player battles pokemons, gym leaders, and develops a storyline in a non-sandbox manner. Players can see dialogues in the "console" box below the box and they can respond appropriately by simply typing on the keyboard. 
Graphics have not been developped yet but we are working on it.
